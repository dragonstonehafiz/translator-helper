      "Uhh... was that erotic rom-com really that profound?\n",
      "What I'm writing is a wholesome rom-com.\n",
      "Uhh... In other words, \\NI should cut down on sexy descriptions?\n",
      "N-no... You can... keep those.\n",
      "Anyway... If you're writing about redevelopment...\n",
      "Category #671 should have info\\N on trade policy and governance.\n",
      "If you have a model town in mind, \\Nhow about looking at through regional data at section #09?\n",
      "J-just looking at the titles is fine.\n",

      "Y-your story is set \\Nin a shopping district, right?\n",
      "The books on commerce and business\\N from #673 will probably be helpful.\n",
      "Huh, I didn't even think about that.\n",

      "They did?\n",

      "R-recently... Y-you've started acting like Yanami.\n",
      "Ah...\n",

      "Uhm...\n",

      "Why?\n",
      "Having someone you don't know\\Ncome up and talk to you...\n",
      "Impossible...\n",
      "That's just you, right? \\N The librarian won't be bothered \\Nwhether you know or don't know...\n",
      "No, they might...\n",
      "Ri-right?\n",
      "If we go to extremes, people who aren't\\N family are all outsiders, right?\n",
      "Up till today, I might have been too\\Ntrusting of others...\n",
      "I-it's fine if you get it.\n",
      "D-don't trust them!\n",
      "It kind of got a little scary.\n",
      "Is this really okay?\\NFor us to use this sort of stylish library?\n",
      "If one of the staff talks to us, \\N an alarm won't go off, right?\n",
      "D-don't worry, borrowing and returning \\N are self check out.\n",
      "We can do it without talking t-to anyone.\n",
      "Then I guess we don't need to worry.\n",
      "I guess, we've become library masters, huh?\n",
      "Th-there's... one more thing... you know.\n",
      "'One more thing'?\n",
      "Y-you can reserve seats at this library.\n",
      "Nu-Nukumizu, have you tried it before?\n",
      "Not at all. How about you?\n",
      "\\NN-no...\n",
      "Like...\n",
      "I was thinking, \"Can't I just use it normally?\"\n",
      "...kind off.\n",
      "I get it...\n",
      "I get cold feet thinking that \\Nsomeone else might need the seat more...\n",
      "B-but... today is d-different.\n",
      "L-let's go for it and r-reserve a s-seat!\n",
      "Are we doing it?\\N Right here and now?\n",
      "Uh... uhm...\n",
      "The booth and lounge seats are...\n",
      "...unavailable.\n",
      "How about a counter seat?\n",
      "The ones that are lined up.\n",
      "Sitting next to a stranger is...\n",
      "...scary.\n",
      "You're right, they're probably enemies.\n",
      "Ah\n",
      "There's a box seat open.\n",
      "The one that's like a bench.\n",
      "O-oh...\n",
      "Let's go there.\n",
      "Umm...\n",
      "Here, right?\n",
      "Komari, you can sit by the window.\n",
      "Ehh\n",
      "We're sitting together?\n",
      "This is for two people, right?\n",
      "And it's the only place that's free.\n",

      "I-I'll continue it later at home.\n",
      "Nukumizu, why are you looking at your phone?\n",
      "Oh, I was thinking I'd check the home page's photos.\n",
      "We need to decide which to use.\n",
      "Eh\n",
      "It isn't just the photo you took earlier?\n",

      "The aquatic building?\n",
      "Y-Yanami is eating like always.\n",
      "Yeah, she really did.\n",
      "As if it was all just being sucked in...\n",
      "Th-there are a lot of photos of Yanami, huh.\n",
      "All the photos of her eating were kind of blurry...\n",
      "...so I had to retake them again and again.\n",
      "Before I knew it, she'd eaten all the Canelé.\n",

      "L-look... over here.\n",
      "It's on purpose.\n",
      "On the contrary, it makes the photo more stylish.\n",
      "Nnn... Uhm...\n",
      "Over here...\n",

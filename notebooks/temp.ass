Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.36,0:03:31.52,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,I'm doing research for a novel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.84,0:03:36.00,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,I'm writing a story about a villainess, so I'm researching things like clothing and architecture.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.80,0:03:41.90,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Aren't you going to do any research?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.28,0:03:44.32,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,I'm doing my research, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.78,0:03:49.44,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,You're probably just using your research as an excuse to read manga and play games, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.44,0:03:50.74,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,How did you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.96,0:03:53.73,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,You can tell just by reading your novel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.73,0:03:59.26,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,I haven't really researched anything, so my descriptions are all over the place, and I don't understand a thing about a woman's heart.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.48,0:04:23.18,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Since we're already at the library...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.29,0:04:26.40,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Could you teach me how to look up materials and stuff like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.28,0:04:28.90,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,...sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.86,0:04:30.21,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Huh?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.00,0:05:02.89,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Is it this one?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.73,0:05:05.83,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Even if I understand the classification, in my case...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.96,0:05:08.49,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,I don't even know what I should be looking up in the first place...

Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.94,0:05:17.95,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,So, what does that mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.51,0:05:22.36,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,For example, what's the theme of that novel you're writing?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.58,0:05:25.21,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,The pros and cons of redeveloping old town areas.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.35,0:05:28.21,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,The theme is the weakening of community ties that comes with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.56,0:05:32.70,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Oh... that steamy rom-com... was it really about such a grand theme?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.88,0:05:35.22,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,What I'm writing is a wholesome romantic comedy.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.46,0:05:39.98,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,So, you're saying I should tone down the sexy scenes, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.68,0:05:44.20,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Uh... no, that's... you can keep it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.98,0:05:49.08,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,By the way... if it's about redevelopment...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.34,0:05:53.73,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Classification number 671, commercial policy and administration.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.46,0:06:01.64,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Even just looking at the book titles could be helpful.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.10,0:06:06.70,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,I see, a new perspective might give you some hints for your research.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.90,0:06:10.84,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Even if it doesn't directly become part of your story, it can add depth to your descriptions.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.40,0:06:14.74,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Your novel is set in a shopping district, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.24,0:06:19.16,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Maybe the commercial stores in 673 could be good material for your story.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.48,0:06:22.78,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Oh, I never thought about it that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.06,0:06:26.54,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Honestly, I don't really know how to use the library all that well.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.54,0:06:28.54,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Maybe they should teach that in school.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.73,0:06:30.54,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,We actually covered that in class.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.80,0:06:31.48,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Oh...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.08,0:06:32.92,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Was it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.73,0:06:39.66,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,If you don't remember it, then it must have seamlessly become a part of you, like water.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.98,0:06:43.73,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,In a way, haven't we achieved the purpose of the lesson?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.98,0:06:47.04,Nukumizu JP,,0,0,0,,Hmm... What's up, Komari?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.64,0:06:51.23,Komari JP,,0,0,0,,Lately... you've been starting to remind me of Yanami.
